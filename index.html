   <h3> <u>What have I learnt?</u></h3>

   <p> Today I learnt about the different kinds of loops - 'while', 'infinite' and 'for', in addition to what 'arrays' and 'array lengths' are. I also learnt how to change items inside an array and how to both expand and reduce arrays. Finally, I learnt what objects are and how to access and change them.  â€‹</p>  

   <h3><u>How did I use this in practice?</u></h3> 

   <p> I wrote a loop which outputs the 7 times table and used a for loop to print a list of some of my favourite foods. I also created an array of my favourite food, before creating an object to hold information on a recipe chosen by myself. Finally, I created a loop to list some of the ingredients and directions for the recipe.</p>  
    
   <h3><u>What did I find hard?</u></h3>

   <p>I found this another really challenging session and somehow accidentally deleted one of my JavaScript files due to mistakenly making more than one, which then got me behind, so I completed the work I was missing after the session. Combining the different techniques together is what I seem to find most hard, and the Take Away Task (3.4.5) looks challenging, however I will give it my best try. </p>
