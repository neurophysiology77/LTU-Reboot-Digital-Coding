    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    What a div is and its function; how to change font colours and styles; how to create borders; what ID's and Classes are and the difference between them; what Cascading is and 'Cascading Priority'.

    How did I use this in practice?
    Created documents containing divs and different font colours and styles. Created borders and inserted ID's (e.g. main headings) and Classes (e.g. font colours). 
    
    What did I find hard?
    Understanding things in a 'human' way - coding sometimes feels like a foreign language! I also ran into difficulty at one point as I'd moved the position of some text to line up neatly with the text above, however by doing this it undid it doing what it was meant to do. I realised this though and moved it back to its orginal position.
