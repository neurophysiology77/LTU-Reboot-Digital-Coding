   <h3><u>26/01/2021</u></h3>
    
   <h3> <u>What have I learnt?</u></h3>

   <p>I learnt about a number of new things today including functions and how to declare and invoke them. I also learnt about arguments, returning values and variable scopes, i.e. global or local. In addition, I learnt about boolean variables and 'if' statements. Finally, I learnt about comparison operators and control flow, i.e. 'else'. </p>  

   <h3><u>How did I use this in practice?</u></h3> 

   <p>I wrote a function with a sentence output and invoked the function later in the code. I also wrote a basic programme combining a first and last name inside a function, before updating the function to accept arguments (first and last name). In addition, I added a return statement to the name function and then set the value of a variable. I then made a temperature variable and created code which tells you to put your coat on if the temperature drops below 50 degrees. I then expanded on this by creating code which tells you to wear a coat and hat if the temperature drops below 30 degrees, and then if less than 0 degrees, to stay inside. Finally, I created code to tell you that otherwise, there is no need to put on a coat and hat. </p>  
    
   <h3><u>What did I find hard?</u></h3>

   <p>I found this lesson really difficult, probably the most difficult yet. I found it difficult to understand some of the concepts and also apply them, and would sometimes make errors due to incorrect bracket positioning or forgetting a semi-colon etc. I also found that there was quite a lot of information to take in at once, however what more seems to be the difficulty is not the amount of information in general, but the type of information - it all just seems very 'foreign' and is completely different to anything I've encountered before (had never used HTML, CSS or JavaScript at all prior to this course). So I think a lot of it is just adjustment and getting used to things so they're less scary! </p>
