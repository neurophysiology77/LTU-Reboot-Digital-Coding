    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    I learnt about positionings (e.g. static, relative and absolute) and Z-indexes. In addition, I also learnt about floats and placing elements side by side, plus use of 'Clear' or clearing. Finally, I learnt about the various different CSS Frameworks available. 

    How did I use this in practice?
    Created a div that contained an image and caption, and attempted to position the caption absolutely over the top of the image. I also created a div with the class of sidebar and a main div, before floating the sidebar and main div, in addition to exploring the Bootstrap website and trying out a few informal tasks from there as a way of becoming more familiar with it. 
    
    What did I find hard?
    (My own!) technical difficulties again - when attempting the absolute positioning task it turns out that I hadn't copied the image link address properly from the website I used, which led to the image not appearing. This took a while to figure out and got me behind but when I realised I was able to rectify this. Then again when completing the floating task it turns out that I'd somehow missed a semi-colon off, which was throwing all of my tags off and not bringing up what was on Luke's screen. However again, when I investigated this and realised my mistake, I was able to rectify this.
