    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    Learnt about spans; pseudo-classes; the Box Model (and what it comprises of) and wrappers. 

    How did I use this in practice?
    Added spans;  created links and added pseudo-classes; added padding, borders and margins; centred the document. 
    
    What did I find hard?
    Everything! My laptop didn't seem to want to play ball today and some tags weren't coming up correctly, meaning I had to re-type them or add manual symbols in front of them such as '>' The lesson (and course) has also grown increasingly complex as it's gone on and it was difficult following more complex instructions at pace whilst my laptop was also being a bit of a nightmare!
