    <h1><u>CPD - Continuing Professional Development</u></h1> 
   
   <h3><u>27/01/2021</u></h3>
    
   <h3> <u>What have I learnt?</u></h3>

   <p>I learnt how to create a function able to return a percentage of a number; how to create a switch statement and how to create a mini 'calculator' capable of adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing/modulus operating on 2 numbers​ ​</p>  

   <h3><u>How did I use this in practice?</u></h3> 

   <p> This was a practical session where I completed the above tasks - created a function to return a percentage of a number; created a switch statement and created a mini calculator capable of the above functions. </p>  
    
   <h3><u>What did I find hard?</u></h3>

   <p>I found this session really hard again, this time due to the independence of it and having to try and think in a logical way and combine concepts. </p>
