    <h1><u>CPD - Continuing Professional Development</u></h1> 
   
   <h3><u>22/01/2021</u></h3>
    
   <h3> <u>What have I learnt?</u></h3>

   <p>I learnt about positionings (e.g. static, relative and absolute) and Z-indexes. In addition, I also learnt about floats and placing elements side by side, plus use of 'Clear' or clearing. Finally, I learnt about the various different CSS Frameworks available.</p>  

   <h3><u>How did I use this in practice?</u></h3> 

   <p>I Created a div that contained an image and caption, and attempted to position the caption absolutely over the top of the image. I also created a div with the class of sidebar and a main div, before floating the sidebar and main div, in addition to exploring the Bootstrap website and trying out a few informal tasks from there as a way of becoming more familiar with it.</p>  
    
   <h3><u>What did I find hard?</u></h3>

   <p>(My own!) technical difficulties again - when attempting the absolute positioning task it turns out that I hadn't copied the image link address properly from the website I used, which led to the image not appearing. This took a while to figure out and got me behind but when I realised I was able to rectify this. Then again when completing the floating task it turns out that I'd somehow missed a semi-colon off, which was throwing all of my tags off and not bringing up what was on Luke's screen. However again, when I investigated this and realised my mistake, I was able to rectify this.</p> 

   <h3><u>Extra Task:</u></h3>
