    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    A number of different style features such as inserting images, changing colours, creating lists (both ordered and unordered) and creating a stylesheet.

    How did I use this in practice?
    Connected a stylesheet to a HTML document; changed the background colour of the document; inserted an image; created ordered and unordered lists. 
    
    What did I find hard?
    I found today a bit overwhelming due to the sheer volume of new information, however it was a relief to know we'd actually skipped forward on the slides accidentally. I think re-reviewing the slides and further practice will definitely help.
