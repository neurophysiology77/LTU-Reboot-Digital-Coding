    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    Recapped GitHub and its functions; learnt about Change Management and Version Control; learnt how to create a repository and clone; learnt what Git branches are and how to 'commit'

    How did I use this in practice?
    Created an HTML file, worked from different branches and committed changes.
    
    What did I find hard?
    Switching between Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop and Github. I also worry about doing things in the correct order and pressing the right buttons!
