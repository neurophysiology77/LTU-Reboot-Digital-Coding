    CPD activity
    Introduction to Web Development
    
    
    What have I learnt?
    The fundamentals and history of HTML; source code; the anatomy of a website and beginner HTML tags. 

    How did I use this in practice?
    Created a HTML page using various styles and also added links. 
    
    What did I find hard?
    I found this session more challenging in terms of keeping up (!) and encountered some difficulties with creating a link to my email, however I believe that in relation to the latter it's my laptop's settings. I will try again later however/try adjusting the settings.
