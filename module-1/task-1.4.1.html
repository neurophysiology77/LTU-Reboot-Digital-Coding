  CPD - Continuing Professional Development
<h1>Continuing Professional Development</h1>

 <h2>Date of CPD activity</h2>
<h2>11/01/2021</h2>
  
  <h3>CPD activity</h3>
  <h3>Introduction to Web Development</h3>
  
  
  What have I learnt?
  
  I have learnt about a number of positions in development, e.g. front end compared to back end, in addition to the tools of the trade such as text editors and GitHub. I have also learnt about the difference between the World Wide Web and the internet and the definitions of 'client' and 'respository'. I have also learnt about many other things such as what a server is and how it functions, in addition to the Responsive Web and Progressive Enhancement versus Graceful Degradation and what's more commonly used now (Progressive Enhancement). Today I learnt more about GitHub, Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop.
  
  How did I use this in practice?
  
  I created a profile on Github, and used Visual Studio Code and Github Desktop to transfer my repository across. I also completed this CPD task and transferred across.
  
  
  
  What did I find hard?
  
  I can be a technophobe in general but there have been no specific difficulties so far thankfully. I'm just making sure I follow everything closely and bit by bit.
